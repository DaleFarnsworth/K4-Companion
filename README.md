## Program designed to remotely control an Elecraft K4 transceiver

K4macro provides a set of buttons, each of which when clicked will
send a macro string to the Elecraft K4 via TCP/IP.  It is capable
of sending string commands to multiple servers, one or more of which
may be transceivers. These macros can be simple or complex. K4macro
was inspired by K4 Macromaster, but in no way duplicates all of its
functions. K4 Macro was initially created by Charles W. Powell, NK8O,
but has been heavily modified. Charles has graciously allowed others
to continue development under the GPL.
